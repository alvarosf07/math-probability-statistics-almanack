It can be either discrete or continuous type. Techniques from calculus and probability theory are used to study the processes. There are numerous kids of stochastic processes. Several kinds of Stochastic processes are going to be given as an example in this notebook.\n<br>\nLets define the stochastic process as a collection of random variables in defined on a common probability space $$(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, P)$$\n,where omega is the the sample space or all the possible outcomes, mathematical F is the sigma-algebra where each set contains zero or several possible outcomes and P is the probability for the realization of the outcomes.\n<br>\nWe define a function with an index t (representing the time) that maps a variable from the set T to a random variable from the state space S or: $$X_{t} : T \\to S$$\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"674f0c97f0605eb4873d78a1ccb88226585e945f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Random Walk\nThe first basic process we will look at is the random walk. It is defined as the path created by the steps which have no rule determining their development. The term 'random walk' was coined by the mathematician Karl Pearson (1857 - 1936) in 1905. The process can either be represented as one or several dimensions.\n<br>\nThere are numerous applications in finance for modeling stocks and price movements (for further reading https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randomwalktheory.asp), the net worth of a gambler, movement of people in the market (such as some agent based modeling), movements of molecules and particles or changes in gene in the genome.\n<br>\nThere are different kinds of random walks, if the steps follow the normal distribution it is said that it is a gaussian type. Other variants of a random walk are self-interacting walks, correlated walks, maximal entropy random walk and others.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"62c275129199caf729b471a8385c1b46fb35ffe3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialization\nnp.random.seed(99)\n\n# Initialize all_walks\nall_walks = []\n\n# Simulate random walk 10 times\nfor i in range(10) :\n\n    random_walk = [0]\n    for x in range(100) :\n        step = random_walk[-1]\n        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)\n\n        if dice <= 2:\n            step = step - 1\n        elif dice <= 5:\n            step = step + 1\n        else:\n            step = step + np.random.randint(1,5)\n        random_walk.append(step)\n\n    # Append random_walk to all_walks\n    all_walks.append(random_walk)\n\n\n#print(all_walks)\n\n# Plot random_walk\nplt.plot(random_walk)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()","execution_count":60,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"97ca2aeae230d7ac4ec6869c6fb63f3fdb043065"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We generate a simulate 100 random walks.

In a future work more processes can be added to the notebook. For an example a Bernuli Process, Levy Process, Markov Process, Gamma Process, Birth Process or even Branching processes.

A list of the processes can be viewed here: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stochastic_processes_topics).\n<br>\nOther topics such as stopping times, recurrency, periodicity and other behaviors have also been excluded.\n<br>\nIt should be noted that a more mathematically rigorous approached can be taken, for example no martingales have been used.\nThe Point of this is for the general reader without much mathematical knowledge. \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cbf456f05516c15beac699a42e0dfaaa1c93c741"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### References\Source: https://www.kaggle.com/code/stephen924/\n1. https://fromosia.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/stochastic-poisson-process/\n2. https://fromosia.wordpress.com/2017/03/09/stochastic-process/\n3. https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markov-chains-python-tutorial\n4. https://www.wikipedia.org/\n5. https://www.datacamp.com\n6. http://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/BrownianMotion.html"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"f52f69b02125071333289b084350b5712854245c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
