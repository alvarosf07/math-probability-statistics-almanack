The attached csv-file (data.csv) contains historical time series for different variables. The variables are GDP (GDP Level), interest rates (LIBOR 1M, %) and equities (Equities Index 1 (index points), Equities Index 2 (index points) and Equities Index 3 (index points)). Please complete the following tasks and provide code implemented, preferably in R. Apply appropriate data transformation if necessary.
- Load the data of the csv  le into a data format of your choice.
- Detect potential outliers for each time series based on a simple methodology. Do not use any outlier-detection package. You are free with respect to the methodology you choose and based on which criterion you de ne outliers. However, ensure that the approach is economically and statistically reasonable.
- Provide a measure of correlation for the different variables at hand.
- Build a simple model that explains Equity 2 by one or more other variables provided. Provide an assessment of the out-of-sample performance for your model for the out-of-sample period 2015/01 to 2017/03.
