# Longest run of heads in a sequence of coin tosses
A coin is tossed n times, thereby generating a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). A subsequence of consecutive heads is called a run of heads. Consequently, the following sequence: 
<br/>

$HHTHTTHHHHTTTHHTTTTH$

of length n = 20 contains 5 runs of heads with lengths 2,1,4,2,1, respectively. The longest run of heads is 4.

<br/>

-  Write an efficient function (in R or Python) that generates random sequences of heads and tails for any value of n.
-  Write an efficient function that computes the length of the longest run of heads in an arbitrary sequence of heads and tails.
-  For a sequence of length n = 1000, we have observed a longest run of heads equal to Mn = 6. Basing your decision on this piece of information, do you believe that the coin is fair or not? Please elaborate on your analysis and results.
